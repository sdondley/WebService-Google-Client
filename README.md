    my $user = 'pavelsr@cpan.org'; # full gmail

    $gapi->auth_storage->setup({type => 'jsonfile', path => '/path' }); # by default
    # $gapi->auth_storage->setup({ type => 'dbi', path => 'DBI object' });  ## NOT IMPLEMENTED
    # $gapi->auth_storage->setup({ type => 'mongodb', path => 'details' }); ## NOT IMPLEMENTED

    $gapi->user($user);
    $gapi->do_autorefresh(1);

    my $r1 = $gapi->Calendar->Events->list({ calendarId => 'primary' })->json;
    warn scalar @{$r1->{items}};

# KEY FEATURES

- Object-oriented calls by API->Resource->method schema. Like $gapi->Calendar->Events->lists
- Classes are generated dynamically using [Moose::Meta::Class](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose::Meta::Class) based on Google API Discovery Service
- Different app credentials (client\_id, client\_secret, users access\_token && refresh\_token) storage - json file, DBI, MongoDB (u can add your own even)
- TODO: DBI and MongoDB not currently implemented
- Automatic access\_token refresh (if user has refresh\_token) and saving refreshed token to storage
- CLI tool (_goauth_) with lightweight server for easy OAuth2 authorization and getting access\_ and refresh\_ tokens
